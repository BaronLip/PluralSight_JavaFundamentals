#### Arrays
Provide an ordered collection of elements. 

**Syntax:**
```Java
float[] theVals = new float[3];
```

Use [] to indicate an array after the data type.
When assigning the value, the number inside the brackets refer to the length of the array, or number of elements.
Arrays are 0 based.

```Java
theVals[0]; // refers to the first item in theVals array.

theVals[0] = 10.0f // assigns the value to the first element of array theVals.

// Assign values to the array during declaration:
float theVals = { 10.0f, 20.0f, 30.0f }
// Note: the length was not needed.
```
