**What is Java?**
Java is both a programming language and runtime environment.


**JRE vs JDK:**
JRE - Java Runtime Environment, is an additional layer of software that runs on top of the computer's OS that smoothes out the diversity of OSs. This allow's for Java to run on most all Operating Systems.
* Required to run Java apps.
* End user only require the JRE.

JDK - Java Development Kit, used to create Java apps. By running Java code through the JDK, the Java app is able to run independant of the platform(OS). JDK creates **Byte codes**, an abstration of code that allows for different OSs to run the app. 

app.java > JDK > Java App(byte codes) > JRE > Host Environment. 

* Tools required to create apps.
* JDK installation includes JRE.

**IDE options:**
* Netbeans - was the official IDE from Oracle but support stopped at v8. Now supported by Apache.
* InteliJ - more current and user friendly.
